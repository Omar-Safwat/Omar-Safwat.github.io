        <p>Seed classiÔ¨Åcation is essential for both marketing and production to provide the principles of sustainable agricultural systems. </p>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset">Dataset</a> is based on the following research paper;
             <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2020.105507">Multiclass Classification of Dry Beans Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning Techniques</a>, 
            where bean images obtained by a computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and feature extraction stages, giving a total of 16 features; 
            12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, from 7 different classes of grains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through insight-driven feature engineering and models ensembling I was able to improve the overall accuracy 
            presented in the research paper by 93% to 96% on the validation set, and 94% on the test set.
