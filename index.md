            Seed classiÔ¨Åcation is essential for both marketing and production to provide the principles of sustainable agricultural systems. <br>

            The <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset">Dataset</a> is based on the following research paper; [Multiclass Classification of Dry Beans Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning Techniques](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2020.105507), 
            where bean images obtained by a computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and feature extraction stages, giving a total of 16 features; 
            12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, from 7 different classes of grains.<br>

            Through insight-driven feature engineering and models ensembling I was able to improve the overall accuracy 
            presented in the research paper by 93% to 96% on the validation set, and 94% on the test set.
